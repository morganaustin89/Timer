    Simulate the discrete-time process with directional bias.
    
    Each pause has a base frequency (interpreted as the chance to occur in a week) from prob_list.
    In each week, unoccurred pauses are attempted in order:
      - The leftmost unoccurred pause has no penalty.
      - The next gets a 10% penalty, then 20%, and so on.
      - If a pauseâ€™s penalty reaches 100%, it cannot occur that week.
    The simulation runs until all pauses have occurred or max_weeks is reached.
